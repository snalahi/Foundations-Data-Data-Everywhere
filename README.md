Data is a collection of facts.

Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

A data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

Data analytics is the science of data.

## Building blocks of data analysis process (Six phases of data analysis): 
#### Ask
In this phase, we do two things. We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. 

#### Prepare
This is where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process. 

#### Process
Here, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information. 

#### Analyze
Analyzing the data you've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. There are lots of powerful tools data analysts use in their work and in this course you'll learn about two of them, spreadsheets and structured query language, or SQL, which is often pronounced "sequel." 

#### Share
Here you'll learn how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions. In the share phase, visualization is a data analyst's best friend. 

#### Act
This is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights you, the data analyst, have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem and will be acting on what you've learned throughout this program. 

Data-driven decision-making involves five analytical skills: 
#### Curiosity
#### Understanding context
#### Having a technical mindset
#### Data design
#### Data strategy

Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.

The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive.

Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.

Data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, all of these things fit under the data analytics umbrella.

Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy.

SUbject-matter experts are the people who are very familiar with the business problem.

Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.

#### Five essential analytical skills: curiosity, understanding context, having technical mindset, data design, and data strategy.

Context is the condition in which something exists or happens.

A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.

Data design is how you organize information.

Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

#### The five key aspects to analytical thinking are visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and finally, big-picture and detail-oriented thinking.

Visualization is the graphical representation of information.

A correlation is like a relationship. You can find all kinds of correlations in data. Correlation involves being able to identify a relationship between two or more pieces of data.

A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs.

Ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights.

Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient. The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

A quartile divides data points into four equal parts or quarters.

Nonprofits are organizations dedicated to advancing a social cause or advocating for a particular effort, such as food security, education or the arts.

Data strategy involves the management of the people, processes, and tools.

#### The life cycle of data is plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy.

During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.

Capture is the phase where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization.

A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system.

The next phase in data life cycle is manage where the considerations are: how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly. This phase is very important to data cleansing.

Next it's time to analyze the data. This is where data analysts really shine. In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and
support business goals.

Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again.

And finally destroy the stored data when required.

#### Questions to answer while going through the Data Life Cycle:
Plan - What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data do you need to answer your question?
Capture - Where does your data come from? How will you get it?
Manage - How will you store your data? What should it be used for, and how do you keep this data secure and protected?
Analyze - How will the company analyze the data? What tools should they use?
Archive - What should they do with their data when it gets old? How do they know when it's time?
Destroy - Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?

Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.
